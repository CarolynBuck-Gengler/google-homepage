# Recreating Google homepage 
I'm working through The Odin Project Web Development 101 course. This project aims to tie together the things I've been learning so far, including and especially working with git and GitHub.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

The skills I've been working on while doing this project included
* sticky footers (not working 100% the way I want it to, alas)
* horizontal navigation bars where some items are on the left and others on the right
* placement of items on the page and subtle adjustments to margin and padding
* styling of elements when hovered
* more advanced use of the Chrome DevTools
